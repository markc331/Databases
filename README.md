### _Santa Clara University Senior Design Project: Dominican Republic Greenhouse Automation System_ 
> A wirelessly connected network of soil quality sensors that store soil temperature and humidity levels. This network uses LoRa communication to ensure long-distance, reliable data transmission and solar panels to power the system efficiently. As a part of this network, an interactable application would aim to streamline the soil data and organize it in a way that can be displayed remotely. We aim to accomplish this through the creation of a dashboard that would include the corresponding temperatures and soil data for both individual green houses.
